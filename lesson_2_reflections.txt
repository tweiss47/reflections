Git Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An initial hidden metadata directory (.git) is created to track information
about the current directory. This allows changes to be tracked.

git init
 -  Creates a new git repository in the current directory

git status
 -  Shows current branch, commit, untracked and changed files in the current
    repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows for changes in the working directory to be selectively
prepared for a commit. It allows a potential commit to be updated and defined
before any changes are made to the repository


git add
 -  Adds files from the working directory to the staging area
